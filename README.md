# PlayingWithJavascript

## Introduction

Just me playing around with some javascript. As of now there is an implementation of Conway's game of life, based on my previous python implementation. Later I might play around with a few other things, perhaps implementing a few simple games (maybe following one of Al Sweigart's python books?).

## Cellular automaton

Right now it just run's Conway's life. I plan to add the ability to change the rule, and may explore CAs with more than two states. Unlike my python implementation, I am not representing the rule as a Wolfram code, so I have to think about how to handle rules for higher state CAs.
